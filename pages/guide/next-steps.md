# Next Steps
We have covered all the interesting features of WebGear in this guide. Here is some more information to guide you
further.

You can find a few example programs [in the source
repository](https://github.com/rkaippully/webgear/tree/master/webgear-examples). These will give you a good idea how
this library is used.

API reference documentation is available in haddock format [in
hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webgear-server).

We also have some [benchmarks](https://github.com/rkaippully/webgear/tree/master/webgear-benchmarks) against other
popular haskell libraries. You may find the benchmark results [here](/static/bench-criterion-users.html). Take these results
with a pinch of salt. Typical real world applications could have very different performance characteristics depending on
a number of other factors. If in doubt, you should benchmark your application and not rely too much on microbenchmarks
such as these.
